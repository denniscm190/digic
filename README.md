# digic
 
A privacy focused command line tool to track your crypto portfolio.

## Installation

```bash
pipx install digic
```

## Documentation

For a comprehensive installation and usage guide check the [documentation](https://docs.digic.app)

## Privacy

Digic works locally, which means that your public addresses are stored locally in your computer. We do not use any 
server to store them. 

## How does Digic get blockchain data?

Digic uses the following APIs to retrieve blockchain data and crypto prices.

1. https://etherscan.io
2. https://blockchain.com
3. https://coingecko.com

## Main objective

I spent some time looking for solutions to track my crypto portfolio. There are many in the market, but I do not trust
them. Most of them store my public keys in servers, and others require some kind of registration to link my public keys 
to my identity. In order to avoid this, I've created Digic.

The idea is to create a program that runs locally, and does not depend on any server or centralized API. This will be 
implemented gradually in future versions.

If you like Digic, please consider becoming a contributor. I need help to improve it.
